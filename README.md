# Bank Loan Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes bank loan data using **MS SQL Server** and **Power BI** to extract key insights, track loan performance, and optimize lending strategies. It covers loan application trends, funded amounts, borrower risk factors, and regional loan distributions.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze loan application trends and track financial performance.
- Categorize loans as **'Good'** or **'Bad'** based on repayment data.
- Identify regional and employment-based lending patterns.
- Create **interactive dashboards** for real-time insights.

## Tech Stack
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server 2022
- **Visualization:** Power BI (February 2025 Version), Tableau (for comparison)
- **Data Processing:** Microsoft Excel 2024


## Data Processing & Analysis
### 1. **MS SQL Server - Data Cleaning & Querying**
-  **Data Import**: Using MS SQL Server
-  **Database Creation**
-  **SQL Queries** for Business Problem Solving
-  **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, incorrect data types, duplicates
-  **Query Optimization**: Using Joins, Aggregate Functions, CTEs, Window Functions

### 2. **Power BI - Data Visualization & Reporting**
#### **Dashboard 1: Summary**
- **KPIs:**
  -  Total Loan Applications (MTD, MoM Tracking)
  -  Total Funded Amount & Amount Received
  -  Average Interest Rate & Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

#### **Dashboard 2: Overview**
- **Key Visuals:**
  -  Monthly Trends (Line Chart)
  -  Regional Loan Distribution (Map Visualization)
  -  Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)
  -  Employment Length vs. Loan Approval (Bar Chart)
  -  Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)

## Business Insights & Recommendations
- **Loan Performance**: Loans with lower DTI ratios perform better.
- **Regional Trends**: Default rates vary by state; stricter assessments needed.
- **Interest Rate Optimization**: High interest rates correlate with higher defaults.
- **Employment-based Approvals**: Longer job tenure improves repayment rates.


## Future Improvements
- Implement **Machine Learning Models** for loan default prediction.
- Integrate **real-time loan data streaming**.
- Enhance **user interactivity** with Power BI reports.
